- **REST Countries API**: To fetch country data, including names, flags, and maps.

## Installation

## How It Works

1. The webpage fetches country data (name, flag, and map link) from the REST Countries API.
2. A pre-defined dataset of emergency contact numbers is used to populate police, fire service, and ambulance details.
3. The user can:
   - View emergency contact details for all countries.
   - Search for a specific country using the search bar.
   - Toggle between light and dark themes.
